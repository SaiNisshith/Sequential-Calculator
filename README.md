# Sequential-Calculator
Implemented a Sequential- Calculator using HTML,CSS & JS.
Here the sequential calculator is the one in which we can continue the operations one after the other. Even after obtaining the answer if we still would like to perform one more operation we can perform it smoothly, without any trouble.
That is is the sequential calculator.

Care is taken to make it userfriendly, so that users can use without any trouble. Once you get accustomed to this, you will appreciate this calculator. So I request all to first use this.
